3 “What is a Credit Score?”** 
### What is a Credit Score?

1. **Your Financial GPA**  
   It’s a 3-digit number (300-850) that shows lenders how risky it is to lend you money.

2. **It’s All About Trust**  
   Higher score = banks trust you more = better loans, lower interest rates.

3. **What Makes Up Your Score?**  
   - **Payment History (35%)**: Do you pay on time?
   - **Amounts Owed (30%)**: How much debt are you carrying?
   - **Credit History Length (15%)**: How long have you used credit?
   - **New Credit (10%)**: How often are you applying?
   - **Credit Mix (10%)**: Do you have a good mix (cards, loans)?

4. **Why Does It Matter?**  
   - Low score = high interest, fewer approvals
   - High score = better rates, easier approval

5. **Ranges Explained**  
   - 300-579: Poor
   - 580-669: Fair
   - 670-739: Good
   - 740-799: Very Good
   - 800-850: Excellent

6. **It’s Not Just About Credit Cards**  
   Loans, utilities, even renting an apartment can involve your credit score.

7. **You Have More Than One**  
   Different scoring models (FICO, VantageScore) = slightly different numbers.
