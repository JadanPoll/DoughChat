Here are some quick, no-nonsense budgeting tips:

1. **Track Every Dollar** — You can’t budget what you don’t know. Use a simple app (like Mint, YNAB, or even Google Sheets) to track income & expenses.
   
2. **The 50/30/20 Rule** — Split income into:
   - 50% Needs (rent, food, bills)
   - 30% Wants (entertainment, shopping)
   - 20% Savings/Investments (or debt repayment)

3. **Prioritize Essentials** — Rent, food, and bills come first. Everything else fits in after.

4. **Set a Cap on Fun** — Give yourself a monthly "fun budget" so you’re still living life, but not wrecking your finances.

5. **Automate Savings** — Treat savings like a bill. Set up auto-transfers to savings so you’re not tempted to spend it.

6. **Review Weekly** — Quick 5-10 minute check-ins each week stop surprises at the end of the month.

7. **Plan for Irregular Costs** — Birthdays, holidays, car repairs — they always come, so budget a little every month to build a buffer.

8. **Cut Subscriptions** — Do you really use all of them? Audit and cancel the ones that don’t add value.

9. **Cash for Problem Areas** — If you overspend on food, withdraw cash for groceries and only use that.

10. **Budget ≠ Punishment** — It’s a tool for freedom. You’re telling your money where to go, so it doesn’t disappear on you.
